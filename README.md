Personal financial plan helper

This is a work in progress / sandbox personal development I'm not a dev so forgive the quick and dirty style ;)

Utlimately it will simulated all goals progress in future and even try to optimize your monthly saving power to reach your goals "sooner".
For some specific goals, some guidances to help you better determine your objective (i.e. "Retirement goal" is supposed to take into consideration inflation impact up to the retirement date and your lifetime during once retired)
